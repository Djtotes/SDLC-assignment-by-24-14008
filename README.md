Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for building software or programs. It ensures clarity, quality, and maintainability. The main phases are:

1. Requirement Analysis  
   Define the purpose and goals of the program. Gather what features or content are needed.

2. Planning  
   Outline scope, resources, and timeline. Decide tools and environment.

3. Design  
   Create the structure or blueprint (e.g., page layout, data flow, wireframes).

4. Implementation (Coding)  
   Write the actual code or markup based on the design.

5. Testing  
   Verify functionality, fix errors, and ensure requirements are met.

6. Deployment  
   Release the program to users (e.g., upload to a server or share the file).

7. Maintenance  
   Update, improve, and fix issues as needed over time.
